This is a tiny research project. Apart from the overall goal we want to achieve some learning outcomes.

### Goal 

Our goal is to improve our energy footprint. Therefore, SmartMeter aims for a fine-grained tracking of the electricity consumption in a family home. 

### Objectives 

The project is less on the hardware side, rather it focusses on software for 

* reliably taking pictures in 15 minutes intervals
* data management across various systems at home as well as on the Internet
* AI based optical character recognition
* unattended operation
* fine-grained consumption statistics

### Expected Results

* 24/7 solution delivering electricity consumption data
* Set of real world pictures used for future AI projects

### Learning Outcomes

* Methods and tools for AI based image processing
* Assess the maturity and ease of use of available tools
