SmartMeter is hardware/software system for 24/7 recording of the overall electricity consumption in a family home. 

It consists of a COTS camera-based embedded computer system which takes pictures of a regular electricity meter. Server software performs an OCR on these pictures and creates a time series report about the overall electricity consumption eventually revealing interesting consumption patterns. 

We may gain insights from this report in order to optimze our energy footprint.
