      <description>SmartMeter records the overall electricity consumption in a family home. It augments a regular electricity meter with an COTS embedded camera system. A server software creates a consumption report providing insights in energy usage patterns.
The list below displays the achieved objectives:
reliably taking pictures data management across various systems at home as well as on the Internet AI based optical character recognition unattended operation fine-grained consumption statistics  In the current design, data is stored and processed on an Internet server outside the physical boundaries of the house.</description>

      <description>The energy consumption report depicts our consumption profile. It reveals patterns which correspond to the behavior of the house&amp;rsquo;s residents. This section exploit statistical regularities to derives some measures optimizing our energy footprint. Concretely, we want to reduce the idle consumption, i.e. the energy usage when devices are not in use.

      <description> This is a tiny research project. Apart from the overall goal we want to achieve some learning outcomes.
Goal Our goal is to improve our energy footprint. Therefore, SmartMeter aims for a fine-grained tracking of the electricity consumption in a family home.
Objectives The project is less on the hardware side, rather it focusses on software for
 reliably taking pictures data management across various systems at home as well as on the Internet AI based optical character recognition unattended operation fine-grained consumption statistics  Expected Results  24&amp;frasl;7 solution delivering electricity consumption data Set of real world pictures used for future AI projects  Learning Outcomes  Methods and tools for AI based image processing Assess the maturity and ease of use of available tools  </description>

      <description>img { max-width: 100%; height: auto; }  This use case diagram depicts SmartMeter’s main services.
The brief design sketch below shows SmartMeter’s hardware and software components. The local embedded camera system uploads the pictures on Dropbox. The server is a remote host on the Internet downloads them from there and performs the OCR processing.
The current design distributes some main services as well as the data across several systems on the Internet.</description>

      <description>SmartMeter is hardware/software system for 24&amp;frasl;7 recording of the overall electricity consumption in a family home.
It consists of a COTS camera-based embedded computer system which takes pictures of a regular electricity meter. Server software performs an OCR on these pictures and creates a time series report about the overall electricity consumption eventually revealing interesting consumption patterns.
We may gain insights from this report in order to optimze our energy footprint.</description>
